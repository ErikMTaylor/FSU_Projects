      <h2>What is a Game Engine?</h2>
        
      <p>
        A game engine is a software framework designed for the development and creation of video games. 
        Developers use game engines to create interactive and immersive experiences without needing to build the foundational code from scratch.
        These engines come with pre-installed packages like multiplayer, audio, physics, AI, scripting, and many more. 
        The game engine is capable of generating the code needed for the game to run, along with debuggers and even a section to test the game.
